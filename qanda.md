### Q&A/FAQ

* What to do if i'm not seeing updates?
  
  Go to the page your expecting updates from, then press Control+Shift+R all at the same time.
  This should clear any cached files, and reload the page. You can also do this manually.

* Gvbvdxx Mod just crashed, what to do?

  Gvbvdxx Mod 2 and above should have a restore point saved, DO NOT use this for daily use, but use it just in case something goes wrong.
  For older versions of Gvbvdxx Mod, you must rely on an backup copy of the project.

* My question is not in the list above, what to do?

  Try looking for the question or ask at our [issues](https://github.com/gvbmod/gvbmod.github.io/issues) page.
  Do not expect us to respond immediatley when asking an issue.
